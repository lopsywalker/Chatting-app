### Abstract
This was an exploration into some basic C programming as well as some general programming concepts (Concurrency, Networking). I feel modern chatting applications are bogged down with the amount of resources they use to run, so I created an application using a lightweight Front-end library. 

### Requirements 

```ncurses library```

### How to run 

#### Server
```make server 
./server```

#### Client
```make client
./client```
