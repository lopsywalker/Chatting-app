### Abstract
This was an exploration into some basic C programming as well as some general programming concepts (Concurrency, Networking). I feel modern chatting applications are bogged down with the amount of resources they use to run, so I created an application using a lightweight Front-end library. 

### Requirements 
Ubuntu:
```sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev```

Fedora:
```sudo dnf install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev```

### How to run 
1. Have at least 1 server instance running in localhost
  - run by first running `make server` and then `./server` 
2. Run client instances
  - similar to server `make client` and then  `./client`
